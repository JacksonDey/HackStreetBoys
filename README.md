###*Rules*

#####Othello
For those of you unfamiliar with Othello, aka Reversi, all you have to do is place a tile on the board where it will flip an opponants tile(s) as it is in between two of your own pieces, whether that be vertically, horizontally or diagonally!  Winner is the one with the most of their tiles on the board!  10/10 very fun

#####MasterMind
The computer will create a code of numbers, 0-6 inclusive, and in 12 guesses you must guess the exact right order of the code!  As you guess, you will be informed if any are the right number, if you are so lucky, and if any are in the right spot.  The computer will not, however, tell you which ones are right!

#####Connect4
Need I say any more?  For those of you unaware, all you must do is get four in a row, whether thatn be diagonal, in a row, or a column.  An instant classic.  

#####Checkers
Another very underground game.  Move diagonally and hop over your enemies pieces to slay them.  Last (wo)man standing type game, whomever is alive at the end wins!
