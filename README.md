###*Rules*

#####Othello
For those of you unfamiliar with Othello, aka Reversi, all you have to do is place a tile on the board where it will flip an opponants tile(s) as it is in between two of your own pieces.  10/10 very fun

#####MasterMind
The computer will create a code of numbers, 0-6 inclusive, and in 12 guesses you must guess the exact right order of the code!  As you guess, you will be informed if any are the right number, if you are so lucky, and if any are in the right spot.  The computer will not, however, tell you which ones are right!
